                             It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

* Content- The content of the box, where text and image appear.

* Padding- Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.

* Border- A border that goes around the padding and content.
* Margin- Clears an area outside the border.

CSS- Selectors- CSS Selectors are used to find the HTML elements which I want to style.
                             We can divide CSS selectors into five categories.

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value).

CSS Element Selector:- The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.

Example:-
 
Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color: 

p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

CSS Id Selector:-  The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element.

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.


CSS Class Selector:- The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
It is to be noted that a class name cannot start with a number.

CSS Universal Selector:- The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
