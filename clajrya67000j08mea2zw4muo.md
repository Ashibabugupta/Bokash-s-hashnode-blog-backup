Web connected all people of the word by a single click.
Suppose we throw one big stone into the center of big pond,
there is web form which goes all around the pond.
If you have a receiver then you catch the signal of the web in any position of the pond.
Similarly, the internet is a network that links millions of computers around the world by web.
Today, the Internet has revolutionized how people use computers. For example, one can read
news stories and movie reviews, check airline and railway schedules, book tickets, shop for
various items, find information on any subject, see street maps, get the weather forecast for
the city, and communicate with others through the Internet.

The World Wide Web- commonly referred to as WWW, W3, or is an interconnected system
of public webpages accessible through the Internet. A web page is a hypertext document
on the world wide web. Web pages are delivered by a web server to the user and 
displayed in a web browser. A web site consists of many web pages linked together under
a common domain name. Hypertext is a system for linking related text documents that
allows the participation of multiple users. hypertext documents are interconnected by
hyperlinks, which are typically activated by a mouse click, keypress set, screen touch.
HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and 
its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of 
bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

**Finally, I would like to say, that all things of Universe must be connected by Web**..
